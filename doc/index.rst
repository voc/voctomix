Welcome to voctomix's documentation!
====================================

**voctomix** is a live video mixer, based on python and gstreamer.

Depending on the capabilities of your hardware, you can use it to mix
up to 4k video. voctomix includes a so-called "stream blanker", which
can be used to show some animation on the livestream while still recording
the mixed video feed to disk.
